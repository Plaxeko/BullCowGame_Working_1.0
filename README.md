# BullCowGame_Working_1.0

This is all the working game logic

1. Get the difficulty level from the user
2. Return a word for the user to guess for based on the difficulty level. 
3. give the user hunts by telling them if they get a letter(cow) and if they get a letter in the correct place for the word(bull)
4. give the user a count for a limited amount of guesses to try and get the word. 
5. I have error handling for both difficulty validation and user guess input validation.
